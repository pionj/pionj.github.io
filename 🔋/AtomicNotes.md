# AtomicNotes

@HowIcrea89:online

> 1. Capture
Jot the idea, concept, insight, or story somewhere down. I usually create a note on my phone or Mac. Others prefer paper notes, and some even use audio recordings.

2. Cluster
Once you have finished reading, watching, or listening, it's time to group your notes. While grouping, try to break free from the author's structure / outline and group your notes into Questions and Topics of your choosing instead. If you don't have one already, create an index-note (a note that simply references all related notes) for each question or topic. This will help you navigate your notes over time. Some people use Maps of Content instead of index notes, but I prefer to keep it simple for now.

3. Make them atomic
Finally, turn your captured notes into atomic ones by applying the rules for atomic notes. Make sure that each note is linked to an index-note as I described in step 2.


## Anatomy
1. One atomic note describes one idea concisely
2. Choose descriptive titles for your atomic notes
3. Make atomic notes understandable without context
4. Atomic notes should link to other notes that are related, opposed, or otherwise relevant
